        .answer
          | The Blocktix System is a platform that replaces the current fragmented
          | markets of event ticket distribution, ticket transfer and event promotion.
          | Blocktix is a single system for all services and provides a low overhead
          | for distributors and promoters, freeing up money otherwise wasted in
          | inefficient market-based systems.

          | Event hosting is an expansive and growing market, yet much like the
          | financial industry, it suffers from constant, systemic challenges
          | regarding fraud prevention, transfers of ownership and intermediary
          | cost. Event hosts use a series of costly, legacy services to provide a
          | solution for these challenges.

              | Ticket distribution services (Ticketmaster, Eventbrite) are used
              | to simplify the ticketing process and to protect against fraud. The
              | associated surcharge for these distribution services can be up to
              | 15% of the ticket value.
            li
              | Intermediary services such as Stubhub are used in the p2p
              | secondary market to combat fraud and counterfeiting losses.
              | Industry wide, fraud losses exceed $1 billion annually. Many
              | P2P transfer intermediaries charge excessive fees to both
              | buyers and sellers.
            li
              | A variety of advertising mediums and services are used to sell
              | available tickets to an event. Advertising costs for an event
              | regularly exceeds 20% of the event's overall budget.
              | Utilizing Ethereum smart contracts, Blocktix offers a near perfect
              | solution to many of the current challenges facing event hosting
              | businesses.

          | How large is the market for Blocktix?

          | The recurring challenges in the event hosting industry provide a
          | substantial opportunity for a system with the ability to resolve these
          | issues to attract a significant share of hosted events.
          | According to Meeting Professionals International, "The American
          | meetings and events industry directly and indirectly supports 6.3 million
          | jobs and generates almost $1 trillion a year in direct, indirect and
          | induced spending. The industryâ€™s direct $106 billion contribution to the
          | U.S. GDP is greater than the amount generated by auto manufacturing
          | ($78 billion)..."

          ul
            li Blocktix will focus on primer artists and DJs popular with the 18-34 demographic.
            li The concerts will be held in venues near college campuses, capable of hosting 10,000 to 15,000 attendees, initially concentrated in California.
            li Most events will be festival style as popular with the 18-34 demographic.
            li The attendees will be required to purchase tickets through the Blocktix application, with ETH/ TIX as the only accepted methods of payment.
            li Budgets for the events will range from $650,000 - $900,000 depending on artists and venues.
            li With a $3million events budget from the crowdsale funding,
              | Blocktix could host as many as 20 events adding
              | 200,000-300,000 users to the Blocktix system (this will be
              | determined by popularity of events).

          | How will mainstream users learn crypto?
          i.icon_chevron-right
        .answer
          | An onboarding exchange portal will be developed and targeted at new
          | users of crypto. This portal will be simple, featureless, and directed at
          | new users only. The portal will look and operate similar to an online
          | bank account transfer. There will be a very small learning curve for any
          | new user to understand how to acquire ETH and use it on Blocktix. In
          | our testing, the learning curve takes less than one minute to acquire a
          | satisfactory understanding of making a transaction on the Blocktix
          | portal.

          | How will Blocktix benefit event hosting businesses and event attendees?
          i.icon_chevron-right
        .answer
          | Blocktix leverages the efficiency of the Ethereum network to reduce
          | fees paid by hosts and patrons by up to 90% from other ticketing
          | systems. Due to the counterfeit-proof nature of the Blocktix blockchain
          | based marketplace, a ticket's proof of ownership is easily verifiable, and
          | even easier to transfer from one person to the next without the need of
          | trusted intermediaries. Another benefit of Blocktix is the real-time
          | accessibility for concertgoers to instantly obtain and sell tickets up to
          | seconds before showtime.

          | Why will Blocktix succeed?
          i.icon_chevron-right
        .answer
          | Crypto based, decentralized systems can offer drastic reductions in cost
          | and improved efficiencies over centralized company systems. The main
          | hurdle of a decentralized system is for the system to gain enough users
          | to experience the benefits of decentralization. Drawing from our
          | experience in the advertising and promotion business we developed a
          | plan to bootstrap the system with tens/hundreds of thousands of active
          | users. See our User Acquisition section for detail.
